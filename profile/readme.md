# Project Donetsk Depreciation Notice

**Dear Users,**

We regret to inform you that **Project Donetsk**, a project dedicated to preserving modern Call of Duty, is now officially deprecated. While the vision to revive the essence of the 2019-2020 era of Call of Duty and restore Verdansk to its original greatness was our primary focus, we have decided to discontinue the project.

### Why is this happening?

After much consideration, we have decided to allocate our resources to other initiatives. This means that **Project Donetsk** will no longer receive updates, bug fixes, or support. We understand the significance of this project to the community and apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

### What does this mean for you?

- **No Updates or Support:** The project will remain available in its current state, but no further updates or support will be provided.
- **Legacy Use:** You can continue to use the project as it stands, but be aware that it may become outdated or incompatible with future updates of the game or related technologies.
- **Future Alternatives:** We encourage you to explore other projects or platforms that may better suit your needs going forward.

### Whatâ€™s Next?
