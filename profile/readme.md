# 🛑 Project Donetsk – Deprecation & Community Continuation

**Dear Community,**

The original **Project Donetsk** — an ambitious effort to preserve and revive *Modern Warfare 2019 / Warzone: Verdansk* — has been officially **deprecated** by its creators. While the vision captured the imagination of many, its development has ended.

---

## ❓ Why Was It Deprecated?

The original team has chosen to shift their focus elsewhere. As such:

- No further **updates**, **patches**, or **official support** will be provided.
- The project is preserved **as-is**, for reference and experimentation.

---

## 🚫 About the Gatekeeping

Unfortunately, throughout this project's history, **certain individuals within the community actively engaged in gatekeeping**, restricting access to tools, knowledge, and resources that should have been shared freely.

We **do not support** this behavior.

This repository — and others like it — stand as part of a **community-led effort** to resist that gatekeeping and ensure modding knowledge is preserved, accessible, and open to all.

---

## 🧭 Where Do We Go From Here?

While this project is no longer maintained, its ideas live on. We encourage you to explore, fork, and learn from it. And if you're looking for a **current, open-source, and active** platform to build with:

## 🙏 Final Thanks
